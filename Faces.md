# Making Faces
Before there were emoji, there were [emoticons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_emoticons), whereby text like `:)` was a happy face and text like `:(` was a sad face. Nowadays, programs tend to convert emoticons to emoji automatically!

In a file called faces.py, implement a function called convert that accepts a str as input and returns that same input with any `:)` converted to 🙂 (otherwise known as a slightly smiling face) and any `:(` converted to 🙁 (otherwise known as a slightly frowning face). All other text should be returned unchanged.

Then, in that same file, implement a function called main that prompts the user for input, calls convert on that input, and prints the result. You’re welcome, but not required, to prompt the user explicitly, as by passing a str of your own as an argument to input. Be sure to call main at the bottom of your file.

<br>

- Recall that input returns a str, per <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input">docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input</a>
- Recall that a str comes with quite a few methods, per <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods">docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods</a>
- An emoji is actually just a character, so you can quote it like any str, a la "😐". And you can copy and paste the emoji from this page into your own code as needed.

Before You Begin
Execute cd by itself in your terminal window. You should find that your terminal window’s prompt resembles the below:

`$`
Next execute
```
mkdir faces
```
to make a folder called faces in your codespace.

Then execute

```
cd faces
```
to change directories into that folder. You should now see your terminal prompt as `faces/ $`. You can now execute

```
code faces.py
```
to make a file called faces.py where you’ll write your program.

# How to Test
Here’s how to test your code manually:

Run your program with `python faces.py`. Type `Hello :)` and press Enter. Your program should output:
```
Hello 🙂
```
Run your program with `python faces.py`. Type `Goodbye :(` and press Enter. Your program should output:
```
Goodbye 🙁
```
Run your program with `python faces.py`. Type `Hello :) Goodbye :(` and press Enter. Your program should output
```
Hello 🙂 Goodbye 🙁
```
